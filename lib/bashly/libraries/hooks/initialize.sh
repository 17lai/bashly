## initialize hook
##
## Any code here will be placed inside the `initialize()` function and called
## before running anything else.
##
## - The raw command line arguments are available to you here as "$@"
## - If you wish to override the raw arguments before they are processed,
##   simply define an array named `input_override`:
##
##     declare -g -a input_override=("modified" "args")
##
## You can safely delete this file if you do not need it.
