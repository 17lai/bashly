  Multiline test
  
  This is a multiline test example. Long lines are going to be properly wrapped at the 80 character mark.

version: 0.1.0

commands:
- name: multiline
  help: |-
    Do some multiline work.

    This is a long process and takes time, therefore it takes a lot of lines to describe and this line is particularly long.

    But - not all hope is lost. Bashly should respect newlines and word-wrap long lines properly at the 80 character mark.

  args:
  - name: my_arg
    help: |-
      Argument with multiline.

      Once again we gather here to prepare some long lines that will most likely seem silly to anyone who reads them.

      But, it is just needed for testing - otherwise, it will not only be silly, but it will also be buggy!

  flags:
  - long: --long
    help: |-
      Long flag with long text.

      Finally, this will be the last multiline string we type (hopefully), but once we are done with this, we will be done with all.
